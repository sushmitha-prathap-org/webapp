# Assignment Submission Project

This project encompasses a full-fledged CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js web application designed for managing assignments and submissions, developed with React and deployed on AWS. Utilizing GitHub Actions for automation, the pipeline integrates various AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and SNS/SQS, along with Packer and Pulumi for infrastructure as code (IaC) practices, ensuring a seamless, automated deployment process.

## Features

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated pipeline using GitHub Actions, facilitating smooth and efficient code integration and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Leveraged Packer and Pulumi for defining and deploying infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments.
- **Auto-scaling Setup**: Configured an auto-scaling Amazon EC2 setup within an AWS Virtual Private

## Technologies used

- **Frontend**: React JS, Typescript
- **Backend**: Node.js-  CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Packer, Pulumi
- **Cloud**: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SNS/SQS, VPC)
